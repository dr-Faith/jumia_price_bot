# jumia_price_bot
A bot which gives the predicted price of a certain product available on the Jumia Ecommerce Platform.

Hello there, this project involves scraping data from the Jumia website, data of about 4000 set of goods was collected via the Scrapy web scraping library and data about 
each set of goods was saved to a seperate csv file. The csv files were then combined together into a single csv file for creating the price bot.
